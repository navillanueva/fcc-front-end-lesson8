<!--    This is going to be the temporary platform we will use for our front end
        In html, when we open a blank document, we can type "!" and press enter to get a basic template
        Anything we write in between <script> tags is going to be compiled as javascript
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fund Me App</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script src="./index.js" type="module"></script>
    <!-- this is how we separate our js from our html and access it

        <button id="connectButton" onclick="connect()">Connect</button>
        <button id="fund"  onclick="fund()">Fund</button>

        We are gonna change these onclick buttons and add them into our js file
        We apply this change because we changed script type from "text" to "module"
        And when we did this change the onlclick function stopped working from the .html file
        -->
    <button id="connectButton">Connect</button>
    <button id="balanceButton">getBalance</button>
    <button id="withdrawButton">Withdraw</button>
    <!-- <form> -->
    <label for="ethAmount">ETH Amount</label>
    <input id="ethAmount" placeholder="0.1" />
    <button type="button" id="fundButton">Fund</button>
    <!-- </form> -->
  </body>
</html>
